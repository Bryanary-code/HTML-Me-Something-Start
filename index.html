      <p><b>Oh hi there, I'm Keeley. This is me when I was living in a shelter when I didn't have a home. As you may be able to tell, that place made me a little anxious.<br> I really wasn't sure where I was, a lot of the other dogs were jerks, and it was always noisy with some kind of drama going down. The people were nice enough, though. Then, one day...</b></p>

   <p><b>...this guy came to visit me. I had no idea who this guy was or how he knew I was here, but he seemed alright for a human. After visiting for a bit, he said he was taking me home. <br>Home? I didn't know I had a home, but if it got me out of that place I was all for it. So, off we went. After a harrowing car ride that felt like an eternity, we finally made it to my new home. It was all new and different, and, I have to admit, it was a bit of a rough start...</b></p>

   <p>I was a liitle beat up from living on the streets and getting roughed up at the shelter. And the itching! Ugh, it was non-stop. I couldn't help but scratch constantly. I thought all of this was just a normal part of being a dog, but my new person said it wasn't normal at all. He wasn't too happy the shelter didn't do anything about it. So, off we went again.</p>
<p>Nooooo! Am I going back to that shelter?</p>
<p>Whew, thankfully it wasn't! It was my new doctor. It wasn't my favorite place, but they gave me some medicine and this stupid thing to put around my head...</p>

<p>Good news! All of my itching went away, and my sores healed up. Best of all, I get to take this stupid thing off of my head and start doing real dog stuff like chasing squirrels up these trees, those trees, and every tree I can find. This is the best!</p>
